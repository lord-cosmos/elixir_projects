For sending an email to 1million users : starting 1 million processes will put sudden pressure on our system resources.

> The solution to our problems is async_stream/3. Itâ€™s another very handy function from the Task module which is designed to create task processes from a list of items. For every item in the list, async_stream/3 will start a process and run the function we provide to process the item. It works just like Enum.map/2 and Task.async/2 combined, with one major difference: you can set a limit on the number of processes running at the same time

How to run the Stream?
